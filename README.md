<h3><strong>Here's how to choose the right CRM solution for your startup</strong></h3>
There are several different types of CRM solutions available today. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. You need to consider what features are most important to your business when choosing a CRM system.

<h3><strong>Salesforce.com</strong></h3>
Salesforce.com is one of the oldest and largest CRM systems on the market. It offers an extensive set of tools for managing contacts, tracking deals, and automating processes. It also includes a robust social media component.
HubSpot is another popular CRM solution. It focuses more on lead generation than other CRMs. Its free version lets users build out a contact database and send emails.
Zoho CRM is a cloud-based solution with a simple interface. It provides a variety of prebuilt templates for common sales activities.

<h3><strong>Zoho CRM</strong></h3>
If you’re looking for a CRM system that will help you manage your sales pipeline, then Zoho CRM might be right for you. It has a simple user interface and a wide range of features. You can use its email marketing capabilities to generate leads and follow up with customers.
Salesforce.com is a well-established leader in the CRM space. It offers a full suite of products, including a mobile app, a web application, and a desktop client. It also integrates with third-party applications such as Google Analytics and Hubspot.

oChats is a <a href="https://www.ochats.io/">CRM system</a> with built-in live chat. It allows you to manage all business chats on 1 platform. It allows you to integrate multiple channels such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, LINE, Zalo & Signal into 1 platform.
